3rd Year Project Ideas:

1) Intrapolation between brute force search and greedy algorithms
and an exploration of the local structures of NP-Hard Problems
1.5) Approximation algorithms?

2) Something in natural language?
2.5) Sentence Fuzzing: gettings setences that mean the same thing
but phrased differently

3) Adversarial RL trading bots

---- Shitty Machine Learning Ideas below here ----
1) Text -> Img & Img -> Text
2) Automatic Tagging of source code for better search functionality on github
3) Invertible GAN for image embeddings
4) Attempt robustness against adversarial attacks by having learned
	values that pixels map to. So each pixel maps to one of
	eight fixed values, with leanred intervals.
5) Analysis on robustness of image detection under increasingly
	agressive image manipulation, preprocessing, crops and
	obfuscations.
6) Determine empirically the trade-off when dropping unused 		connections, between accuracy and size and robustness.

--- Misc Ideas ---
1) Rank the irrationality of numbers by determining how well
	they can be approximated as fractions of
	arbitrary bounded size, then sort them.
